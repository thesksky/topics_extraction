# topics_extraction
Open data Raw-recipes file from Kaggle.com listing recipe name, ingredients, and many other things.
Attempted to extract topics from recipe names which could be Desserts, Snacks, Soups, etc.
These topics would be described by key words.

Features: When recipes are sorted by topic, one can look through Desserts for inspiration (that's what I would do)
as opposed to always searching for a scpefici recipe.
